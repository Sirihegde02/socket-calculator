Question-2 statement:
Write small client - server codes which use the socket for communication. When run, the client should be prompted to enter a pair of (x, y) 
integers and a calculation operant (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and then send them to the server. The server then calculates the result 
in the form of:
x operant y
Then send the result back to the client. Then, the client will display the calculated result. After one calculation round has been completed, 
the client can:
1. Send another calculation request, which is similar to the one described above
2. Or send one change request. 
For the change request, the client sends a message in the form of the following:
change x to x_value
or
change y to y_value
then the server calculates the new value and sends the new result to the client for display.
